# Demo 3

Some text

1. you use git init to initialize git folder
2. Use git add <file_name>
3. Use git commit -m "created README" -m "description on"
4. Create same git repository from Github
5. Once created, use git remote add origin <SSH_link computer> (remote refers to somewhere else but not on the computer)
6. You can use git remote -v which shows any remote repositories connected.
7. you then use git push -u origin main (sets the main branch as default by using 'u')

Git branching: master is the naming convention for the main or the default branch.

Keep in mind that you don't need to add when using github because it does itself.

the code on master and feature branch will exactly be the same.
Basically, the idea is that you can deviate from the original branch (in this case is 'main') to other branches such as 'feature branch' or 'bug fixing branch', swtich back on forth until you fix the issues.

to create another feature you use 'git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
to switch between branches you use 'git checkout <branch_name>
