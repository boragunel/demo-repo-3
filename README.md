# Demo 3

Some text

1. you use git init to initialize git folder
2. Use git add <file_name>
3. Use git commit -m "created README" -m "description on"
4. Create same git repository from Github
5. Once created, use git remote add origin <SSH_link computer> (remote refers to somewhere else but not on the computer)
6. You can use git remote -v which shows any remote repositories connected.
7. you then use git push -u origin main (sets the main branch as default by using 'u')

Git branching: master is the naming convention for the main or the default branch.
to findout which branch you are on you use the command: 'git branch' on terminal
to switch between branches, you use the command: git cbheckout <name_of_branch>

Each branch only keeps track of the changes made on its own branch.
to create a new branch you use:
git checkout -b <name_of_my_new_branch>
